Assistant Professor in St.Francis College ❗️ PhD in Computer Science @ NJIT ❗️ Biomedical Informatics Researcher ❗️ BIOSTEC 2025 Session Chair ❗️ IEEE-BIBM2024/2025 Program Committee

About me
======
I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Cybersecurity at St. Francis College, where I teach and mentor students in areas such as data science, artificial intelligence, and software engineering. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), where I conducted research in the Structural Analysis of Biomedical Ontologies Center (SABOC). SABOC, part of NJIT’s Department of Computer Science, is devoted to exploring the structural and conceptual foundations of biomedical ontologies, including widely used systems such as SNOMED CT, NCIt, NDF-RT, and ChEBI.

My research bridges computer science, biomedical informatics, and artificial intelligence. I focus on applying data mining, natural language processing, and large language models to uncover meaningful patterns and knowledge from biomedical and healthcare datasets. Beyond data-driven approaches, my work also involves ontology engineering—particularly quality assurance methodologies, ontology summarization techniques, change analysis, and the structural study of families of ontologies.

Ultimately, my long-term goal is to advance AI-driven methods that can enhance knowledge discovery, improve healthcare decision-making, and support high-quality biomedical data management. I am passionate about both research and teaching, and I enjoy inspiring students to explore how computing can solve complex, real-world problems in science and medicine.
